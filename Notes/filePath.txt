relative path - path from current location ex.chd to bhakarnan
use / or ./to go deep at one step
and we have go levle up then 
../file_name -> one level up

absolute path - path from starting like earth to bakran , actual path
ex C:\Users\DELL\OneDrive\WebDev
we can also use forward slash hereissues

starts from root directory
browsers mostly blocks these paths

not widely used in web WebDev due to privacy/security

as if that file from sever during redening on local machine contains 
some path that in our pc has private file
and retrive them using some technique caues
