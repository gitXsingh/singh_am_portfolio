How computer share info to each other using nwtwoking with speical numvber known as ip that is known by sender and reciever(when conncted to internet)
|ip ->S| data |ip-> R|
and this ip is provided by isp-internet service provider , when we turn on hte internet - very dynamic
and the sirtes we have acess - their addreses are stoered by dns

to prevent issues on social media alonf with ip mac is is also sent as ip is dynamic it chages but mac do not chnage 


port no: works wioth ip + mac : 16 bit unsigned
it tells which apps requested for data on a client side which is in 1,0 format
every wesite has iffernet port number

ip is also public and private

ipv4: 32 bit (0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255)
total addresed can be formed  = 2^32 = 4.3 billion  = 430 cr

ipv6: 128 bit 
total addresed can be formed  = 2^128 = 340 unid..

mac : 48 bit : hexaecimal , no of mac adres in one device  =  no of ways to tranfer data


router used to conncted make connection in differnt lans and combine make internet
ip ad are globallu not uniue inside a network LAN its uniue outsite the router in another network it can be same 
but as it is accece throught router's ip so no isuues as router ublically have unique ip


noways router  have routiner+switvh+Wireless acess control inside

//local ata tranfers can be done throught mac only no ne of ip \
